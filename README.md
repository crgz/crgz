### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer passionate about [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) and 
[Artificial (generic) Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). I have been building [all sort of Internet Applications](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conradom) since 1994. Now I spend most of my time engineering the present and the future tools to extract meaning from online retailers' offers. 

I work almost every waking hour. It is often painful and it is not recommended to put so many hours into work. I do it because of my painstaking perfectionism regarding [code Performance Metrics](https://www.red-gate.com/blog/software-development/learning-from-the-accelerate-four-key-metrics). I believe that the better they become the higher the chances for success in an ever changing environment. Also, I am from Costa Rica, the second country with long working hours according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
