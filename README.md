I am passionate about [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) and [Artificial (generic) Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). After building [all sort of Internet Applications](https://www.linkedin.com/in/conradom) I am now engineering the present and the future tools to extract meaning from online retailers' offers. 

I work almost every waking hour probably because I am from Costa Rica, the [second country with long working hours](https://news.co.cr/costa-ricans-among-hardest-working-world/57046/) according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). It is often painful and it is not recommended to put so many hours into work.

I am working also on a minimal parser for [Multilingual Incomplete & Abbreviated Dates](https://github.com/crgz/fuzzy_dates). Please let me know your thoughts regarding the technical approach.
