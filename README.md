### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Software Engineer pasionate about [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning) and 
[Artificial (generic) Intelligence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence). I have been building all sort of Internet Applications since 1994. Now I spend most of my time engineering the present and the future tools to meaning from online retailers offers. 

I use to work every waking hour. I know it is painful to work long hours and it is not recommended to anyone to put so many hours into work. I do it because 
of my painstaking perfectionism regarding code Performance Metrics. I believe that better Performance Metrics are the key to react to environmental challenges and increase the chances for succeess. 

Working long hours is also a cultural topic. I am comming from Costa Rica, the second country for long working hours according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD).
